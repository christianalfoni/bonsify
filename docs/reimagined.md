# Reimagined

MobX has been a cornerstone in the JavaScript ecosystem for state management since its inception. Originally introduced as Mobservable by Michel Weststrate at ReactiveConf, it offered a novel approach to state management through transparent reactive programming. The initial reception was mixed, partly due to its unconventional name and concepts. However, after rebranding to MobX, it gained widespread recognition and adoption. ￼ ￼

Over the years, both JavaScript and React have undergone significant transformations which have prompted a reimagining of MobX. On one end Mobx has become more complex because of `async/await`, leading to the `flow` utility using the low level generator primitives of the language. On the other end React has moved completely away from classes, creating a new set of patterns and paradigms.

Despite the evolution of the ecosystem, MobX remains a battle-tested and exceptionally performant solution. Its ability to observe changes at any nested level of the state and embrace JavaScript’s natural mutability sets it apart. However, to stay aligned with modern development practices, MobX can benefit from a refreshed approach:

1. **Functional Programming Alignment**: Functional patterns can harmonize MobX with contemporary JavaScript and React practices. By utilizing functions, developers can create state management solutions that has less mental friction moving between components and state management

2. **Simplified State Protection**: Moving away from explicit actions and flows and rather expose state as `readonly` reduces boilerplate and mental overhead

3. **Unified Reactive Primitive**: Introducing a single, cohesive reactive primitive, `reactive`, streamlines the API, prevents bad practices and allows for a new set of utility functions that helps you manage state as opposed to only manage observability

## Conclusion

MobX’s foundational principles remain robust and relevant. By reimagining its implementation to align with the functional programming paradigm and modern JavaScript features, MobX can continue to offer a powerful and intuitive state management solution. This evolution will not only enhance developer experience but also ensure that MobX remains at the forefront of state management libraries in the ever-evolving JavaScript ecosystem.
