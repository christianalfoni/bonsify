# A single primitive

Making something **simple** is about giving you the freedom to use the language to apply whatever encapsulation, constraints and patterns you think fits your application. The only thing you really need from a library is to enable components to observe changes to the state you expose to them. Exactly how you structure and expose that state does not have to be an opinion by the state management tool.

By providing one single primitive of `reactive`, and a plugin that makes your components observers, **Bonsify** makes state management for React as simple as technically possible.
