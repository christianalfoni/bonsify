# A single primitive

By providing one single primitive, `reactive`, and a plugin that makes your components observers,
**Bonsify** makes state management for React as simple as technically possible.

Making something **simple** is about giving you the freedom to use the language to apply whatever encapsulation, constraints and patterns you think fits your application. The only thing you really need from a library is to enable components to observe changes to state you expose to them. Exactly how you structure and expose that state does not have to be an opinion by the state management tool.

After a decade of abstraction, primitive and concept overload you might feel lost just using the language again. But do not fear, we'll get you going!
